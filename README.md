# Spotify-Analysis
This project analyzes Spotify track data to uncover trends in music popularity using data visualization and machine learning. It preprocesses the dataset, explores feature correlations, and applies models like Linear Regression and Random Forest to predict track popularity. 


#### Spotify Data Analysis & Prediction
## Overview
This project analyzes and predicts Spotify track popularity based on various audio features such as danceability, energy, tempo, and more. It also explores data trends through visualization and applies machine learning models to predict track popularity.

## Key Features
1. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, removing duplicates)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

3. Correlation heatmaps for feature relationships

4. Popularity prediction using machine learning (Linear Regression & Random Forest)

## Technologies Used
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

2. Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)

3. Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Run the notebook step by step to preprocess the data and perform EDA.

2. Train machine learning models to predict track popularity.

3. Evaluate model performance using MSE and RÂ² score.
